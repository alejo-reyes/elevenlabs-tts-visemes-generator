Frankly, my favorite morning habit is sipping steaming coffee beside a massive bookshelf, flipping through famous philosophy volumes. Sometimes, I mumble softly or babble about baffling metaphysics. Vanessa, my vibrant parrot, mimics perfectly, squawking phrases like 'Save my biscuits!' and 'Marvelous breakfast!' before fluttering off. Pretty funny, right?
